# Disney_Villain_Game
Hello, please find included a zip file that contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a quote matching game.

I do not claim any rights to the included pictures, fonts, colors, or any other IP. If there are any issues I will gladly remove this project.

To be able to play:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Unzip the contents into a singular folder.
3. Open the HTML file (Chrome works best).

To play:
1. Once the game loads, you can choose Easy (3 choices of Villain), or Hard (6 choices of Villain). 
2.Then simply match the quote with the picture of the correct Villain.
3. If you get it right you can request another quote (Currently there are 75 quotes).
4.Once you are ready to see your score click on the Results button.

Thank you for your time!
